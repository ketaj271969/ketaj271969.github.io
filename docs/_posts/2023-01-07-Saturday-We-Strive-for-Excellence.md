[We Strive for Excellence](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=vqAuSHR_RFU&feature=share)

I love this song for it's references to Evel Knievel and tetanus in the same breath.  "We deliver where Knievel failed! What's a little bit of tetanus?" Basically, walking the walk...

```
I have a hammer, a box of nails
Two M80s' and punk sticks
My uncle's favorite Farrah Fawcett lighter
A Schwinn hurricane with BMX grips
We deliver where Knievel failed
What's a little bit of tetanus?
Pledge allegiance to the denim flag
And strive for excellence

Yes we do, we strive for excellence
Yes we do, the dinner bell ain't calling me home

I found at least a dozen two by fours
Marine grade plywood
No six million dollar men
No retakes, no Hollywood
One and done, feet off the pedals
Naive elegance
Salute the denim, light the pyro
And strive for excellence

Yes we do, wee strive for excellence
Yes we do, the dinner bell ain't calling me home

You're in the Cub Scouts, right?
I believe I need a tourniquet
I can hear my mama calling
Hand over that snake bite kit
We deliver where Knievel failed
What's a little bit of tetanus?
Pledge allegiance to the denim flag
And strive for excellence

Yes we do, we strive for excellence
Yes we do, we strive for excellence
Yes we do, we strive for excellence
Yes we do, yes we do
We strive for excellence
```
